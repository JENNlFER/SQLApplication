Our Version allows for various commands to be entered into the command editor, and displays&#10;status and error log messages.&#10;&#10;&#10;In preferences you can do various things as well with our emulator. For instance, you can choose to&#10;have status and error log files created. Also, it is to your choosing how you break up commands &#10;within the editor. We allow for this to be completed through an empty line, an end of line character, &#10;or even a semicolon.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, we allow for you to open, save, or even run various sql scripts. The file extensions of these&#10;types of files can also be edited within our preferences window. The command editor itself follows&#10;the mysql language. This is in conjunction with commands like CREATE DATABASE or INSERT &quot;&quot; INTO.&#10;&#10;&#10;The three jpeg like icons enable you to use three common commands with your commands in the &#10;editor.For instance, the lightning bolt runs all commands while the lightning bolt with the I within &#10;it allows only one command that is either highlighted or the cursor is on to be run. This preference&#10; is also handled in our (you guessed it) preferences tab. Play around with the editor and experience&#10;our user friendly interface with complex features made simple.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
